    1.To play them requires knowledge and skill. To play them well requires practice and maybe a bit of advice.
    2.read the instruction manual on the butten control and anything else you might think you would need help on.
    3. set the difficulty to rookie if your new to games, put it on hard if you are experienced and if you are in between then put it on normal.
    
    I will go to my house to play or i could go to my friend house to play.
    
    It my favorite hobbie because it is so copetitive so their are people that will always be better and your always trying to get better than them.
    
    From what I can remember I started when i was 4 years old.
    
    The game if new is $59.99 and the lowest amount a game can go to is $19.99 but for very old games go to around $4.99.
    Your bleeding your pockets for these games if you get the new games everytime. If you land a career as a game designer
    will be around $50,000 a year. If you put alot of time into it you can get up to $125,000 a year.
    
    My friends and my family pay games with me but mostly my friends and my brother.
    
    I have a lot of expeience in all game and to make myself better I competite with other players.
    
    No, I have not won an award for my video game hobbie.
